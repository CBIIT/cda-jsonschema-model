property	description
age_at_collection	The age of the Patient when this sample was taken.
analyte_type	When the specimen is of type 'analyte' or 'aliquot', this is the type of substance the analyte represents (e.g. DNA, RNA)
anatomical_site	Per GDC Dictionary, the text term that represents the name of the primary disease site of the submitted tumor sample; recommend dropping tumor; biospecimen_anatomic_site.
byte_size	Size of the file in bytes. Maps to dcat:byteSize.
cellular_composition	The cellular composition of the sample
checksum	 
code	The value of the code itself.
conformsTo	An established standard to which the described resource conforms; for CDA, https://github.com/CancerDataAggregator/cda-data-model. Maps to dcat:conformsTo.
data_category	 
data_type	 
days_to_birth	Per GDC Dictionary, number of days between the date used for index and the date from a person's date of birth represented as a calculated negative number of days.
days_to_treatment_start	The date and optionally time that the treatment was started in integer.
days_treatment_end	The date and optionally time that the treatment was terminated in integer format.
dbgap_accession	The link to the dbgap accession record for data associated with this Study. For MVP, will model this as a string, but this could be modeled as an external reference.
dct_title	Official project name. Maps to dct:title.
derived_from_specimen	A source/parent specimen from which this one was directly derived.
describedBy	The URL reference to the JSON Schema that defines this object.
disease_site	A list of the text terms used to describe the primary site of disease.
disease_type	A list of the text terms used to describe the type of malignant disease. 
display	A human-readable name for the code.
embargo_date	The date on which publication and release of data is permitted.  This data is made available with the condition that it cannot be published or disseminated before this date.  The field is represented as a string in this format: CCYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[Z|(+|-)hh:mm].
file_format	String to identify the full file extension including compression extensions.
general_tissue_morphology	A term describing at a high-level the kind of tissue collected in a specimen, with respect to disease status or proximity to tumor tissue (e.g. is it normal, abnormal, tumor, tumor-adjacent).  
harmonized_disease_type	Harmonized disease type based on CCDH model; for MVP, the ETL process will consult the table of harmonized disease_types provided by CCDH to set this value. GDC disease_type.  This may be removed from the model in future and replaced with an API call that determines this value based submitting the CodeableConcept to a vocabulary service which will return the canonical value to be used for search.  In future, CCDH will provide a vocabulary service, allowing us to request the canonical disease name for searching based on the CodeableConcept for disease_type submitted by the DCs.  This field will not appear in data submitted by the DCs.
id	The 'logical' identifier of the entity in the repository, e.g. a UUID.  This 'id' is unique within a given system. The identified entity may have a different 'id' in a different system.
label	Human-readable name of the Study
license	A legal document or data use agreement under which the resource is made available. Maps to dct:license.
matched_normal_flag	A flag indicating that there is no matched normal aliquot for this case that can be used for variant calling purposes.
media_type	Specific media type according to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). String that captures dct:MediaType (https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml).
primary_disease_site	The text term used to describe the primary site of disease (that qualifies the ResearchSubject for this Project), as categorized by the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O). This categorization groups cases into general categories.
primary_disease_type	The text term used to describe the type of malignant disease (that qualifies the ResearchSubject for this Project), as categorized by the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O). 
program	The text term used to describe the parent program for this project.
qualification_status_flag	A flag indicating whether the specimen is qualified or disqualified for data analysis in a study.
reference_assembly	URL or string representing the organism-specific reference assembly.
reference_url	Ontology persistent URL. For example, http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/NCBITAXON/ 
research_subject	Reference to the ResearchSubject UUID.
source_material_type	The general kind of material from which the specimen was derived, indicating the physical nature of the source material. 
specific_tissue_morphology	A term describing the specific pathology exhibited by the tissue in a specimen.
specimen	Reference to the Specimen used for this diagnosis.
specimen_type	The high-level type of the specimen, based on its how it has been derived from the original extracted sample.  
system	The system or namespace that defines the Study.
taxon	The taxonomic group (e.g. species) of the patient. For MVP, since taxonomy vocabulary is consistent between GDC and PDC, using text.  Ultimately, this will be a term returned by the vocabulary service.
term_id	Term identifier with prefix or full url. For example, 9606 for NCBITAXON Human or phs
term_label	Human-readable label for the term.  Maps to rdfs:label.
text	A human language representation of the concept represented by the Coding
treatment_outcome	Text name for treatment outcome; this will ultimately be defined by a common vocabulary
treatment_type	Text name for treatment type; this will ultimately be defined by a common vocabulary
type	A code that defines the type of the identifier.
value	The value of the identifier, as defined by the system.
version	The version of the ontology or reference source.
wasGeneratedBy	The project(s) responsible for generating this dataset.  These should be references to the projects, UUID preferably. Maps to prov:wasGeneratedBy.
